                    there are many licensed firms that trade in them as a
                    legitimate financial services, investment in binary options

                    Cryptocurrency investment scams include Initial Coin
                    Offerings (ICOs). These are ways that new cryptocurrencies
                    fund their startup by offering new investors the opportunity
                    to receive coin tokens in return for money. While legitimate
                    ICOs do exist for the development of genuine
                    cryptocurrencies, they are also a favourite mechanism used
                    in cryptocurrency fraud.

                    Many ICOs are marketed without any real technology or
                    legitimate business plans to back them by individuals or
                    small groups with little to no industry or IT experience. In
                    recent years regulatory bodies have prosecuted scam ICO
                    perpetrators. In 2019, the US Securities and Exchange
                    Commission charged the CEO of a software company worth $42
                    million, for defrauding investors through an ICO.

                    One example of a crypto scam is the advertisements you may
                    have seen on popular social media platforms. These often
                    show up on Facebook using photos of well-known celebrities
                    such as Mel Gibson, to entice people into cryptocurrency
