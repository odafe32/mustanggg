                    Cryptocurrency investment scams include Initial Coin
                    Offerings (ICOs). These are ways that new cryptocurrencies
                    fund their startup by offering new investors the opportunity
                    to receive coin tokens in return for money. While legitimate
                    ICOs do exist for the development of genuine
                    cryptocurrencies, they are also a favourite mechanism used
                    in cryptocurrency fraud.

                    Many ICOs are marketed without any real technology or
                    legitimate business plans to back them by individuals or
                    small groups with little to no industry or IT experience. In
                    recent years regulatory bodies have prosecuted scam ICO
                    perpetrators. In 2019, the US Securities and Exchange
                    Commission charged the CEO of a software company worth
                    $42million, for defrauding investors through an ICO.

                    Dating scams play on your emotions with the aim of
                    persuading you to provide money, gifts or personal
                    information. You may be approached on dating websites or via
                    social media before the scammer works to move communications
                    to more private and less regulated channels like text or
                    email.

                    Your ‘love interest’ will pursue a seemingly strong
                    connection with you, despite plans to meet in person never
                    materialising. Once they have secured your trust, they will
                    ask you to send money for things like healthcare fees,
                    travel costs or investment opportunities. In reality, they
                    will either pocket these funds and/or use your bank account
                    for further fraudulent activity.

                    Often run by international crime syndicates, online dating
                    scams can also pose a serious danger to your personal
                    safety. You may be lured abroad and tangled up in perilous
                    situations with devastating consequences. Don’t take the
                    risk.
